# Keylogger-Project
This Python script demonstrates basic keylogging functionality. 

It captures keystrokes and appends them to a log file.

Usage:

Ensure you have pynput installed: pip install pynput.

Run the script.

Keystrokes will be logged to a file named log.txt.

Note: This script is a basic example and lacks features like stealth mode or encryption. Use it responsibly.
